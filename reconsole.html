The team knew that we would have to position ourselves to provide information that was contextual as well as actionable. After going through the interviews, we understood that while finding information was important, the overall information was fragmented and took additional parsing to extract the actual value.</p>

                <p class="project-content-copy">We knew that just aggregating wasn’t enough value unless there as actionable data as well.</p>
                <p class="project-content-copy">Due to the fact that the information was so fragmented and disjointed, the first step was to clean the data and give users a complete view of the market around them. We accomplished this with our first feature, parcel groups.</p>
                <p class="project-content-copy">When you currently search a comp, it’s simple to see who the owner is, but it’s fairly difficult knowing what else it is that they own. When you’re doing larger land deals, knowing that an owner owns 5 parcels directly next to each other is a massive advantage.</p>
                <p class="project-content-copy">If you were to have to find this information now, you would have to start by finding an owner, then go into the public records and search what other parcel they own. The problem with this is that a majority of the time owners hide the purchases within shell companies.</p>
                <p class="project-content-copy">Our solution was to parse those public records, combine with with the corresponding owner information, and display that information is an easy to use dashboard. </p>

                <p class="project-content-copy">Given that this was my first start up position, let alone being able to completely shape a drive a product, the experience was invaluable and I learned what it truly takes to get a product into the users hands.</p>
                <p class="project-content-copy">On top of the UX/UI tasks, it also allowed me to learn more frontend technologies like react, Git, and database technologies.</p>
